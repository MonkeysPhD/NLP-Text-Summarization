## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks to showcase the work.

## Notebooks
### 1. Summarizer_BERT
   - This notebook presents the completed project, demonstrating the implementation of BERT, a pre-trained model, as the text summarizer. It includes code, explanations, and results of the summarization task.

### 2. NLP_Attempt
   - This notebook documents the attempt to create an alternative text summarizer using a different approach. Although my efforts were unsuccessful, I wanted to transparently share the process and the lessons learned from it.
